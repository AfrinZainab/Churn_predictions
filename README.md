# Churn_predictions
To identify the churn and non-churn customer of telecommunication company, machine learning algorithms ( classification models) were employed.
Staking, an ensemble technique was build using Random forest as final model, since this gave the best evaluation scores.
staking was done using Logistic classifier, Descision tree classifier, Random forest classifier and XG Boost, as building block algorithms for the final model.
